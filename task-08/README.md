This project was created using HTML,CSS as well as Javascript to make a convient site to display the Weather at the region that the user searches up.
A personal account was created on the OpenWeather site and the API key from the site was used to get the weather data and establish a connection. To make the site a chrome extension, a manifest.json file was coded which was then unpacked in the browser. A great task to explore how to create extensions as well as integrate API keys to extract information.
