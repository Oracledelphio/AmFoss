My method of approach towards tackling each of the problems thrown at me was to take out the key requirements of each situation and trying to find a logic/ decompose the problem into 
understandable sections. Must admit that the challenges did give me a run for my money and some of them still do, it has been an interesting experience to say the least. I wasn't able to solve all of it but i have accomplished a good bit of work.
