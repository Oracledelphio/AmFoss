## 🏏 Crickey Bot 🏏
The bot offers three main features necessary for the completion of the task namely !livescore,!generate and !help. Upon using the command !livescore,
it provides the user the match details and runs scored. !generate creates a csv file with all the previous requests stored within it. !help gives the user a
look over all the available commands. Task was straightforward and provided me new knowledge on creating of discord bots as i had never attempted web scraping.
The project required me to import quite a lot of modules which did run into a bit of trouble but at the end of the day it all worked out.
