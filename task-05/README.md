# 🐉Imagine Dragons🐉
Website for the Band Imagine Dragons, which consists of interactive buttons which redirects the user to the shop as well as other social media accounts the band is available on.
The website is created using HTML and CSS programing language. All the elements on the webpage has been created manually along with button animation using basic css. One of my favourites if not my favourite task out of the bunch (maybe biased due to my love for designing and web development and such). Learnt alot of new aspects through this task and enjoyed every second of the project's creation.
