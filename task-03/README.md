This task consisted of writing code to take an input from the user int the form of a number and find all the prime numbers till the given 'n' (inclusive).
This had to be done in multiple different programming languages and in order to complete this, I went over roughly over the basics of each language using Youtube tutorials i could find.
An interesting experience this was to explore the various other languages and given more time would love to explore these languages further.
