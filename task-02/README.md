# Creating and Hosting Hugo Website

Successfully created a hugo site using the Theme PaperMod and after what felt like a decade of trial and error in attempt to host at Gitpages, it worked!. My approach to this project was the site to feel classy yet functional. Resources i used to learn hugo was from youtube videos.
